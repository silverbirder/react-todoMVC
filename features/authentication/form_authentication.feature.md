# Feature: Form-Based Authentication

In order to learn how to use Serenity/JS with Cucumber and WebdriverIO
As a Curious Developer
I'd like to see an example

## Background:

* Given Alice starts with the "Form Authentication" example

## Scenario Outline: Using username and password to log in

["The Internet"](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) is an example application
that captures prominent and ugly functionality found on the web.
Perfect for writing automated acceptance tests against ðŸ˜Ž

Note: With **Serenity/JS** you can use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
to better describe each `Feature` and `Scenario`.

* When she logs in using "<username>" and "<password>"
* Then she should see that authentication has <outcome>

### Examples:

  | username | password             | outcome   |
  | tomsmith | SuperSecretPassword! | succeeded |
  | foobar   | barfoo               | failed    |
